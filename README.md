## Our Git Experience

As data science aspirants, this was our first time diving into a collaborative project using Git, and let me tell you, it was quite the experience! The main objective was to learn how to effectively use Git and GitHub while working as a team. 

We had so much fun pushing and pulling code on GitHub, and it really made us realize how a professional environment works in terms of collaboration. 

## Challenges We Faced:

1. **Pushing Changes**: We struggled a lot with pushing our changes to the repository. Sometimes we had conflicts, and it was frustrating trying to figure out how to resolve them. There were times when we thought we lost our work because we didn't know how to handle merge conflicts properly.
   
2. **Merging Branches**: Merging our branches was another challenge. We had to make sure that the changes from both of us didn’t overwrite each other’s work. We had to communicate a lot to avoid overlapping changes and some conflicts were to be resolved manually.
   
3. **Pull Requests**: Understanding how to create and review pull requests was tricky initially. We kept asking each other if we were doing it right!

## Lessons Learned

Despite the struggles, we learned a lot about version control, collaboration, and the importance of communication in a team setting. We figured out how to effectively branch out our work and merge changes. It was a valuable experience that has definitely improved our Git skills!
